This is an example of using the [tingle.js](https://robinparisi.github.io/tingle/) library to add a modal dialog to a web page in a way that has zero additional dependencies and works with NGP VAN forms.

The [example](example.html) should be self explanatory. Paste in the example code and change the content in the `<div id="modal-content">` element to be whatever you want.
